This repository contains a **CLI (Command Line Interface)** project developed in Rust, with the main goal of learning and experimenting with the language.

🔧 **Project under constant development and evolution.**

## 🤖 About the Future

While currently a terminal-based To-Do app, the goal is to transform it into a **Telegram bot** or even a **Telegram Mini App**.  
This will allow users to manage tasks directly from Telegram, making the experience more accessible, interactive, and platform-independent.

## ⚠️ Warning

This code is part of my learning process.  
There may be areas for improvement, non-optimized parts, or even some bugs.

> **belador** is a task manager (TODO CLI) written in Rust, designed for users who want true productivity in the terminal. It’s not just an “add/list/delete” app, but a complete system to organize, search, filter, and sync your tasks, with advanced features and customization options.
